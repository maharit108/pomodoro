# Pomodoro

Accordint to Wikipedia, the Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.

This is a chrome extension that can help enforce Pomodoro technique.

### User Stories:
- As a user, I can decide my work and break durations, so that I can focus on my work during work sessions and then take a break to relax during break sessions.
- I can remove alarms when I dont need to use Pomodoro technique.
